Open app_defines.hpp (infiSTAR.de_xm8apps\@infiSTAR_customApps\addons\a3_infiSTAR_Exile_customApps\app_defines.hpp) in a text editor.
It is self explaining :)

After you have added your custom apps (or just modified the default apps I have put in) you simply pbo the whole folder
"a3_infiSTAR_Exile_customApps" and drop the pbo into 

yourgameserver\@ExileServer\addons\   HERE

once you start your @ExileServer, it will automatically load this pbo and start it with the server.
